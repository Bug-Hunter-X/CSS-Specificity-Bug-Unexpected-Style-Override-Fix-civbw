The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of a selector does not occur due to specificity issues:

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container div {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

.container div.special {
  background-color: lightgreen; /* This style should override the previous one */
}

.container .special {
  background-color: lightpink; /* This style is more specific and overrides lightgreen */
}

<div class="container">
  <div class="special"></div>
</div>
```

The intended behavior is that the inner `div` with class `special` should have a `lightgreen` background. However, because the selector `.container .special` is more specific than `.container div.special`, the `lightpink` background is applied instead.
